        <h2 class="main-title">Our History</h2>
        <p class="main-text">The firm is built on the foundation of more than 1,200 predecessor institutions that have come together through the years to form today's company.

            We trace our roots to 1799 in New York City, and our many well-known heritage firms include J.P. Morgan & Co., The Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank One, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Chemical Bank, The First National Bank of Chicago, National Bank of Detroit, The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., Robert Fleming Holdings, Cazenove Group and the business acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. Each of these firms, in its time, was closely tied to innovations in finance and the growth of the U.S. and global economies.</p>
            <h2 class="main-title2">Our Goals</h2>
            <p class="main-text2">Our Goals are to launch globally and to help people with their choices of where to put their investments, giving them low fees for our services and with low interest percentage.</p>
